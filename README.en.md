The aim of the library's development is to avoid the [drawille](https://github.com/asciimoo/drawille) library's [AGPLv3](https://github.com/asciimoo/drawille/blob/master/LICENSE) license trapping. We use a totally different logic to achieve the same functionality, in the hope of creating a fully independent and free software. To preserve the original source's independence, we did not use the API of drawille library, and did not use the same code logic, allowing a completely new way to present the braille characters' graphics.
